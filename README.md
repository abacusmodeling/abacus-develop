# Features

ABACUS provides the following features and functionalities:

1. Three types of supported basis sets: pw, LCAO, and LCAO-in-pw.
2. Ground-state total energy calculations using Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT) with local-density, generalized gradient approximations (LDA/GGAs), Meta-GGA(requires LIBXC, only for PW), and hybrid functionals (PBE0 and HSE06, only for LCAO and currently under test).
3. Geometry relaxations with Conjugated Gradient (CG), BFGS, and FIRE methods.
4. Semi-empirical van der Waals energy correction using the Grimme DFT-D2/D3 scheme.
5. NVT and NVE molecular dynamics simulation. AIMD, DP potential, LJ potential are supported.
6. Stress calculations and cell relaxations.

# Quickstart guide

## Input files

The following files are the central input files for ABACUS. Before executing the program, please make sure these files are prepared and stored in the working directory.

- `INPUT`

    This is the main input file that contains the setting parameters used in the calculation. For a complete list of the input parameters, please consult this [instruction](docs/input-main.md).

    *Attention: Users cannot change the filename “INPUT” to other names.*
- `STRU`

    This is the structure file that contains the structural information about the system, e.g., lattice constant, lattice vectors, and positions of the atoms within a unit cell. The positions can be given either in direct or Cartesian coordinates. Moreover, the name of the atom (and location of the pseudopotential and numerical orbital files, see below) needs to be specified in the STRU file. The name of the structure file can be changed to a different name by explicitly specifying the name in the INPUT file.

    Specifications of the STRU file can be found in this [short instruction](docs/input-stru.md).
- `KPT`

    This is the k-point file that contains the information of the k-grid setting for the Brillouin zone sampling.
    Specification of the k-point file can be found in this [short instruction](docs/input-kpt.md).
- The pseudopotential files

    Norm-conserving pseudopotentials are used in ABACUS, in the UPF file format.The filename of each element’s pseudopotential needs to be specified in the STRU file, together with the directory of the pseudopotential files unless they are already present in the working directory.

    More information on pseudopotentials is given [here](docs/features.md#pseudopotentials).

- The numerical orbital files

    This part is only required in LCAO calculations. 
    The filename for each element’s numerical orbital basis needs to be specified in the STRU file, together with the directory of the orbital files unless they are already present in the working directory.
    ABACUS provides numerical atomic basis sets of different accuracy levels for most elements commonly used. Users can download these basis sets from the [website](http://abacus.ustc.edu.cn/pseudo/list.htm). Moreover, users can generate numerical atomic orbitals by themselves, and the procedure is provided in this [short introduction](docs/generate-basis.md).

## Run ABACUS

After putting all required input files under one folder, enter this folder.
```bash
cd input_folder
```

Perform calculation by:
```bash
mpirun -np 4 abacus
```

You can replace `4` with your desired number of process, typically the result of the command `nproc`.

## Output files

When the calculation finishes, the program will create an output directory (default: OUT.ABACUS/),
into which the following output files will be generated:

1. `INPUT`: contains all input parameters, user’s input and default.
2. `istate.info`: information of energy eigenvalues.
3. `running_${calculation}.log`: contains the running details. Information on the variable calculation is found in the [list of keywords](docs/input-main.md#calculation). For example, if we are doing a SCF calculation, the log files will be named running_scf.log.
4. `STRU_READIN_ADJUST.cif`: structure file in the cif formatter.
5. `warning.log`: errors and warning messages.
6. directories containing element information. For example, Si/:
    - `Si.NONLOCAL`: non-local pseudopotential projectors.
    - `Si-P.ORBITAL`: pseudo atomic orbitals, p orbital
    - `Si-S.ORBITAL`: pseudo atomic orbitals, s orbital
    - `v_loc_g.dat`: vlocal in G space

## Hands-on examples
The following provides basic sample jobs in ABACUS. More can be found in the directories `examples/` and `tests/`, with an introduction [here](tests/README.md), and the corresponding reference outputs can be found in the file `result.ref` under each subdirectory.

*Note that the examples there are intended as quick hands-on jobs, and the results are NOT converged with regard to basis set or k point sampling.*
