 * @note The direct k-vectors have been set (kd_done = true) but the Cartesian k-vectors have not (kc_done =

 *
 * @param kv The K_Vectors object containing the k-point information.

 *
 * @note This function is only compiled and used if MPI is enabled.
 * @note The function assumes that the number of k-points (nkstot) is greater than 0.
 * @note The function broadcasts the flags kc_done and kd_done, the number of spins (nspin), the total number of
 * k-points (nkstot), the full number of k-points (nkstot_full), the Monkhorst-Pack grid (nmp), the k-point offsets
 * (koffset), and the segment IDs of the k-points (kl_segids).
 * @note The function also broadcasts the indices of the k-points (isk), their weights (wk), and their Cartesian and
 * direct coordinates (kvec_c and kvec_d).
 * @note If a process has no k-points to work on, the function will quit with an error message.
