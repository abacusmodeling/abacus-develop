# This is a test makefile for Electronic-structure
#
# This particular makefile defines all the executables and objects
# files needed, who they depend on, and the compilation defaults.#
# The file makefile.local is included below.
# That file defines the actual commands to use to run the C++
# compiler, library options and directories, etc., all of which are
# machine specific and depend on the local installation.  Hence the name.
