These examples show how to calculate the bands structures.
It requires two steps of calculation:
1. Do the scf calculation and output the information of charge:
   - set 'calculation' to 'scf'
   - set 'out_chg' to '1'
2. Do the nscf calculation and output the information of band:
   - set 'calculation' to 'nscf'
   - set 'init_chg' to 'file'
   - set 'out_band' to '1'
   - set 'pw_diag_thr' to a suitable value when basis_type is 'pw'
Generally, in step 2, the KPT file has the 'LINE' mode (an example is lcao_Si2/KLINES)
to calculate a series of specified k points.  

Finish! Then you can see BANDS_1.dat in OUT.ABACUS. Plot it!

Note:
1)If the "out_band" is used, the BANDS_1.dat will appear in the directory.
2)Learn the "Gamma" and "Line" mode of "KPOINTS".
3)The charge density needed to be output in scf calculations and be read
in non-self consistent calculations.
