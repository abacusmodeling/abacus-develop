Here are two examples:

1. Generate projectors (a series of bessel functions) for DeePKS. \
A file named `jle.orb` will be generated which contains the projectors.

   - see pw_H2O

2. A scf calculation with a trained DeePKS model loaded. A few .npy files will \
be generated which are for DeePKS training only. The total energy and \
force will be output in a way as a normal SCF job does. 

   - see lcao_H2O
