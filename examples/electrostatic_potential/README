By setting ‘out_pot’ to ‘2’ in the INPUT file, ABACUS will output the electrostatic 
potential, which consists of Hartree potential and the local pseudopotential. 

After finish the calculation, you will see the following two files in the output directory:

- ElecStaticPot: contains electrostatic potential (unit: Rydberg) in realspace. 
This file can be visually viewed by the software of VESTA.

- ElecStaticPot_AVE: contains electrostatic potential (unit: Rydberg) along the z-axis 
(here z-axis is the default direction of vacuum layer) in realspace.
