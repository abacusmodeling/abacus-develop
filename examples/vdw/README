ABACUS provides three Grimme DFT-D methods, including D2, D3(0) and D3(BJ), 
to describe van der Waals interactions. Among them, the D3 method has been 
implemented in ABACUS based on the dftd3 program written by Stefan Grimme, 
Stephan Ehrlich and Helge Krieg.

The user can set the vdW-corrected methods in INPUT file with the parameter, 
'vdw_method':
 - none: the vdW corrections are not included
 - d2: DFT-D2 method
 - d3_0: DFT-D3(0) method
 - d3_bj: DFT-D3(BJ) method
