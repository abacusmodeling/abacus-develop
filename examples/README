/*******************************************************************************/

These examples show how to use ABACUS to do some specify calculations and how to 
use the interfaces between ABACUS and some extenal softwares.

The examples interface_XXXX show the using of interface of ABACUS and XXXX

Except for interface examples, a bash script `runall.sh` is required for each example
directory to be accessed by `dflow_run.py`. Each example directory may contains several
examples for different systems or input settings, where a bash script `run.sh` is
required to run the specific example. The `SETENV` is read by `run.sh` to get the 
executable directory of abacus (`ABACUS_PATH`), number of processes (`ABACUS_NPROCS`) and 
number of threads (`ABACUS_THREADS`).

How to run dflow_run.py:

- `python3 dflow_run.py --find 1`:
   find all directories where `runall.sh` has been prepared.

- `python3 dflow_run.py --run 1`:
   submmit dflow jobs.

- `python3 dflow_run.py --post 1` 
   checkout the status of jobs.
