WELOCOME TO THE "ABACUS" PROGRAM.

(1) ABACUS stands for

"Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at UStc"

(2) There is a sub-package called

"SIA" stands for "Systematically Improvable Atomic orbitals generator"

---------------------------------------------------------------------
There are generally 5 directories in this package.

bin:
Contains some executable files.

data:
Contains some basic data you may use in the calculation. It further includes two subdirectorie:
1. elements: pseudopotential files of a selected set of elements, ORBITAL_INPUT and reference
   and reference basis set.
2. structures: various structures.

examples:
Contains test examples.

source:
Contains the source code and various makefiles for different hardware platforms.

tools:
Contains the script for generating numerical atomic orbitals.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently ABACUS provides the following features and functionalities:

1. Ground-state total energy calculations using Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory
(DFT) with local-density or generalized gradient approximations (LDA/GGAs).
2. Brillouin zone sampling using the Monkhorst-Pack special k-points.
3. Geometry relaxation with both Conjugated Gradient (CG) and BroydenFletcherGoldfarbShanno (BFGS) methods.
4. Semi-empirical van der Waals energy correction using the Grimme DFT-D2 scheme.
5. NVT molecular dynamics simulation using the Nose-Hoover thermostat.
