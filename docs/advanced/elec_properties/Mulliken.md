# Mulliken Charge Analysis

From version 2.1.0, ABACUS has the function of Mulliken population analysis. The example can be found in [examples/mulliken](https://github.com/deepmodeling/abacus-develop/tree/develop/examples/mulliken). \
To use this function, set ‘out_mul’ to ‘1’ in the INPUT file. After calculation, there will be an output file named 'mulliken.txt' in the output directory. In the file, there are contents like (`nspin 1`):

The file gives Mulliken charge in turn according to the order of atoms in the system. For example, the following block is for the first atom in system (`nspin 2`),

```
0            Zeta of Si               Spin 1              Spin 2                Sum                Diff
...
Total Charge on atom:  Si                   4
Total Magnetism on atom:  Si      -1.2739809e-14
```

And the next block is for the second atom in system, and so on.

```
1            Zeta of Si               Spin 1              Spin 2                Sum                Diff
...
```

For each atom, the file gives detailed Mulliken population analysis at different levels,

-   magnetic quantum number level: such as lines beigin with ‘s,px,py,pz,...’
-   azimuthal quantum number level: such as lines begin with ‘sum over m’.
-   principal quantum number level: such as lines begin with ‘sum over m+zeta’. Here ‘zeta’
    equals ‘zeta’ in the file, which means how many radial atomic orbitals there are for a given orbital angular momentum.
-   atomic level: such as lines begin with ‘Total Charge on atom’.

More orbital information can be found in 'Orbital' file output with 'mulliken.txt' when `out_mul 1`
