ABACUS Documentation
=================================================

ABACUS (Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at UStc) is 
an open-source computer code package based on density functional 
theory (DFT). The package utilizes both plane wave and numerical 
atomic basis sets with the usage of norm-conserving pseudopotentials 
to describe the interactions between nuclear ions and valence electrons. 
ABACUS supports LDA, GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid functionals. Apart from 
single-point calculations, the package allows geometry optimizations 
and ab-initio molecular dynamics with various ensembles. The package 
also provides a variety of advanced functionalities for simulating materials, 
including the DFT+U, VdW corrections, and implicit solvation model, etc. 
In addition, ABACUS strives to provide a general infrastructure to facilitate 
the developments and applications of novel machine-learning-assisted DFT methods 
(DeePKS, DP-GEN, DeepH, etc.) in molecular and material simulations.
