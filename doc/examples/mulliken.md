# Mulliken charge

[back to main page](../../README.md)

From version 2.1.0, ABACUS has the function of Mulliken population analysis. To use this function, set ‘out_mul’ to ‘1’ in the INPUT file. After calculation, there will be an output file named mulliken.txt in the output directory. In the file, there are contents like:

 Total Charge on atom  Si                   4

The file gives Mulliken charge in turn according to the order of atoms in the system. For example, the following block is for the first atom in system,
```
0 Si Up spin Down spin Sum Diff
...
Total Charge on atom Si 4.0241712
```

And the next block is for the second atom in system, and so on.
```
1 Si Up spin Down spin Sum Diff
...
```
For each atom, the file gives detailed Mulliken population analysis at different levels,
- magnetic quantum number level: such as lines beigin with ‘s,px,py,pz,...’
- azimuthal quantum number level: such as lines begin with ‘sum over m’.
- principal quantum number level: such as lines begin with ‘sum over m+mul’. Here ‘mul’
equals ‘multiple’ in the file, which means how many radial atomic orbitals there are for a given orbital angular momentum.
- atomic level: such as lines begin with ‘Total Charge on atom’.
