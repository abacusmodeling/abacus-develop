# Installation

## Prerequisites
In order to compile ABACUS, users should make sure that the following prerequisites are
present:

- C++ compiler, supporting C++11. For example, [Intel C++ compiler](https://software.intel.com/enus/c-compilers) or [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/);
- Fortran compiler;
- MPI compiler. The recommended version are [Intel MPI](https://software.intel.com/enus/mpi-library) or [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/);
- [Boost C++ library](https://www.boost.org/);
- The ScaLAPACK library. For example, [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl)
or [Netlib ScaLAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/);
- The [FFTW library](http://www.fftw.org/). ABACUS now supports both FFTW2 and
FFTW3;
- The [ELPA library](https://elpa.mpcdf.mpg.de/);
- The [CEREAL library](https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/);

## Building the program
Before starting to build the program, note that if you are using Intel MKL library, please set the following environmental variable:

```bash
export MKL_NUM_THREAD=1
```

To compile the ABACUS program, go to the source directory:
```bash
cd source/
```
Then open and edit the file `Makefile.vars` using any editor tools you like, e.g., vi:
```bash
vi Makefile.vars
```
Specify the location of the compiler and libraries present in your own machine:
```
CPLUSPLUS =
CPLUSPLUS_MPI =
FORTRAN =
LAPACK_DIR =
FFTW_DIR =
BOOST_DIR = 
ELPA_DIR =
CEREAL_DIR =
```
For example, below is a case where the Intel C++ compiler, Intel MPI are used, along with Intel MKL library. The file Makefile.vars can be set as
follows:
```
CPLUSPLUS = icpc
CPLUSPLUS_MPI = mpiicpc
FORTRAN = ifort
LAPACK_DIR = /opt/intel/.../mkl/lib/intel64/
FFTW_DIR = /opt/fftw-3.3.8/
BOOST_DIR = /opt/boost/1.64.0/
ELPA_DIR = /opt/elpa/2016.05.004/
CEREAL_DIR = /opt/cereal/
```
Another example is where GCC, GFORTRAN, MPICH and ScaLAPACK are used:
```
CPLUSPLUS = g++
CPLUSPLUS_MPI = mpicxx
FORTRAN = gfortran
SCALAPACK_DIR = /opt/scalapack/
FFTW3_DIR = /opt/fftw-3.3.8/
BOOST_DIR = /opt/boost/1.64.0/
ELPA_DIR = /opt/elpa/2016.05.004/
CEREAL_DIR = /opt/cereal/
```
For this option, it is further required to set the parameter `LIBS` in `Makefile.system`:
```
LIBS = \
-lgfortran -lm \
-openmp -lpthread \
${SCALAPACK_DIR}/lib/libscalapack.a \
/opt/lapack/lib/liblapack.a \
/opt/blas/lib/libblas.a \
/opt/blacs/lib/libblacs.a \
${FFTW_LIB} \
${ELPA_LIB} \
```
After modifying the `Makefile.vars` file, to build the program, simply type
```bash
make
```
If the compilation finishes without error messages (except perhaps for some warnings), an executable program `ABACUS.mpi` will be created in directory `bin/`

# Installation with DeePKS

This part of installation is based on [Installation](#installation). If DeePKS feature is requied for [DeePKS-kit](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepks-kit), the following prerequisites and steps are needed:

## Extra prerequisites
- C++ compiler, supporting **C++14**. For example, Intel C++ compiler 18
- [LibTorch](https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-1.9.0%2Bcpu.zip) for cpu, with c++11 ABI;
- [Libnpy](https://github.com.cnpmjs.org/llohse/libnpy/);

## Extra settings for building

### Using Cmake

```
cmake -B build -DENABLE_DEEPKS=1
``` 

### Using Makefile
Set `LIBTORCH_DIR`and `LIBNPY_DIR`in `Makefile.vars`. For example: 
```
LIBTORCH_DIR = /opt/libtorch/
LIBNPY_DIR = /opt/libnpy/
```

In `Makefile.system`, add `LIBTORCH_LIB` to  `LIBS`, then set `-std=c++14` in `OPTS`:
```
LIBS = -lifcore -lm -lpthread ${LIBTORCH_LIB} ${LAPACK_LIB} ${FFTW_LIB} ${ELPA_LIB}	#for DeePKS
#LIBS = -lifcore -lm -lpthread ${LAPACK_LIB} ${FFTW_LIB} ${ELPA_LIB}
```
```
OPTS = ${INCLUDES} -Ofast -traceback -std=c++14 -simd -march=native -xHost -m64 -qopenmp -Werror -Wall -pedantic -g
```

In `Makefile`, set the Macro as `HONG_DEEPKS`:
```
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CHANE HERE IF YOU LIKE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#! change series version or parallel version~~~
#HONG=${HONG_MPI_SELINV_20210523}
#HONG=${HONG_SER_SELINV}
HONG=${HONG_DEEPKS}
```
